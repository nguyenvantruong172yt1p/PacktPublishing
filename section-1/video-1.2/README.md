# Video 1.2

This video demonstrates Jenkins X.

## Prerequisites

To try out this example for yourself, you will need a Jenkins X cluster up
and running. You can accomplish this by following the instructions in the
rest of Section 1.

## Import

This directory contains source code from a Jenkins X quickstart example. Once
you have a Jenkins X cluster, you can add this software to your Jenkins X
cluster using the `jx import` command:

```
jx import spring-boot-http-gradle
```

Or, even easier, you can follow the instructions in Video 2.1 to create
this application from the original quickstart.
