# Video 2.5

This video demonstrates viewing pipeline logs for Jenkins X builds.

## Prerequisites

To see pipeline logs for jobs in your own cluster, create your Jenkins X
installation as described in Section 1, then add at least one application as
described in Video 2.1 or 2.2.

## Applications, Activities and Logs

As we saw before, you can get a list of applications using:

```
jx get applications
```

You can also get a list of build activities:

```
jx get activities

Finally, you can see specific build logs:

```
