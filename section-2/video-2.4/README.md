# Video 2.4

This video demonstrates the Prow web interface that shows a build status
screen.

## Prerequisites

To see the Prow status screen and build status for jobs in your own cluster,
create your Jenkins X installation as described in Section 1, then add at
least one application as described in Video 2.1 or 2.2.

## Prow

Prow is a Kubernetes native CI/CD server. It is triggered by webhooks from
the Git repository and runs builds in Docker containers in Kubernetes. It
provides a basic status page and also reports build results back to GitHub
as updates to pull requests.

See the video for details on Prow.
